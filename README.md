# Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In

We're working for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement. Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in.

## Understanding the Data

To reach our goal, we could organize surveys for a couple of different markets to find out which would the best choices for advertising. This is very costly, however, and it's a good call to explore cheaper options first

One good candidate for our purpose is [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969). freeCodeCamp is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run a popular Medium publication (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of our analysis.

The survey data is publicly available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey). Below, we'll do a quick exploration of the 2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv file stored in the clean-data folder of the repository we just mentioned. We'll read in the file using the [direct link here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey/master/clean-data/2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv).
